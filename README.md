# STRAINZ

Purpose of this script is to scrape the STRAINZ marketplace and identify units that are relatively cheaper than others.

I have attempted to fit a Linear Regression to this, however results are skewed due to low sample size and outlier sales data. Further work can be done with
the trade API here: https://api.bsc.strainz.tech/trades.
